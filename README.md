## Project-1
### Pet Name Generator
TOOLS : Python | Langchain | GooglePalm | Streamlit

Note - pip install langchain==0.0.28

Upon launching the Streamlit app, users can input the type and color of their pet to generate five unique pet names. This pet name generator serves as an introductory project to explore LangChain concepts. By clicking the submission button, the app will display five names in the Streamlit interface. For this project, I utilized Google's PaLM as the language model.
